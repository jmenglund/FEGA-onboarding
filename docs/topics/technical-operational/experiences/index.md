# Selecting submission pilots

## Sweden

### What did we do?

The Swedish node selected [SweGen](https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2017130) as its first submission pilot project a few years before FEGA was officially launched. This project was chosen because staff at the Swedish ELIXIR node had been involved and because the dataset was considered to be a good genomic reference for the Swedish population.

To avoid relying on a single pilot dataset, the node eventually decided to engage with two additional projects. At that point, the node had gained a better understanding of what a good pilot project would look like. A few candidates were selected among projects that had expressed interest in depositing data at the node. Semi-structured interviews were then held with two candidate projects before they were officially selected. The local helpdesk team (at the time consisting of only two persons) was responsible for the selection process, but the final decision was made at FEGA node's management level.

### What went well?

For the semi-structured interview, the local helpdesk team created a questionnaire. This allowed the node to collect necessary information before pilots were selected and made  the evaluation easier to perform. Asking the questions was in itself a good way to inform the candidates about the nodeâ€™s expectations. The questionnaire included questions related to for example data availability, dataset details (e.g.submission type, file types and file sizes), legal matters (e.g. ethical permit and data processing agreement) and information about people that needed to be involved (e.g. their roles and their availability).

### What could have gone better?

Having a strategy already when selecting the first pilot would probably have made the node's work more efficient. It would also have made it easier for the node to communicate its expectations to the people that represented the candidate projects. In retrospect, we would probably have selected three pilot projects from the start.

### What did we learn?

Good communication of expectation with external stakeholders is key to success. It is also crucial that the people you engage with in the pilots have the motivation, patience and time to devote to the work.
